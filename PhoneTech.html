      <li>I love technology, from looking at how to fully customize the UI, to the code behind the system. </li>
        <li>Since I'm poor the things I find more intersting is looking at budget phones that stand up to bigger name flagships</li>
        <li>One of my all time favorite phone companies is <a href="https://oneplus.net">One Plus</a>, they create high quality phones with amazing specs. These phones have been referred to as 'IPhone Killers'.</li>
        <li>The company is fairly new and has only released 6 phones; the OnePlus One, Two, X, Three, Three T, and Five.</li>
        <li>The OnePlus Five was released in June with Snapdragon 835, 8gb of RAM, 128gb storage, and a dual camera equiped with a telephoto lense, for only $539.</li>
